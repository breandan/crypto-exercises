# crypto-exercises
Exercises for JavaOne4Kids session (KID7786). Work in progress.

Here we demonstrate some simple ciphers and how to break them. This repository contains sample code, implementing the following ciphers:

* [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)
* [Isogram cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isogram#Uses_in_ciphers)
* [Mixed alphabet (random) cipher](http://crypto.interactive-maths.com/mixed-alphabet-cipher.html)
* [One-time pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad)

Exercises can be compiled and run using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/), or with [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
